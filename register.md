- `"name": "members-connector"`: Specifies the name of the Kafka Connect connector, which in this case is "members-connector."

- `"connector.class": "io.debezium.connector.postgresql.PostgresConnector"`: Specifies the Java class that implements this connector, which is the Debezium PostgreSQL connector. Debezium is a platform for change data capture (CDC), and this connector is used to capture changes from a PostgreSQL database.

- `"tasks.max": "1"`: Indicates the maximum number of tasks to run for this connector. In this case, it's set to 1, which means only one task will be used for capturing changes.

- `"database.hostname": "postgres"`: Specifies the hostname or IP address of the PostgreSQL database server. In your Docker Compose setup, it's likely that "postgres" is the hostname defined for your PostgreSQL container.

- `"database.port": "5432"`: Specifies the port on which the PostgreSQL database server is listening. The default PostgreSQL port is 5432.

- `"database.user": "postgres"`: Sets the username to be used when connecting to the PostgreSQL database.

- `"database.password": "postgres"`: Sets the password for the PostgreSQL user.

- `"database.dbname" : "postgres"`: Specifies the name of the PostgreSQL database to connect to. In this case, it's "postgres."

- `"database.server.name": "pg_claims"`: Defines a unique name for this connector instance, which is used as a prefix for the Kafka topic names to which the captured changes will be published.

- `"table.whitelist": "claims.members"`: Specifies the whitelist of tables that should be captured by this connector. In this example, it's set to capture changes from a table named "members" in the "claims" schema of the PostgreSQL database.

- `"value.converter": "org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter"`: Specifies the converter used to serialize the captured change events into JSON format before publishing them to Kafka.

- `"value.converter.schemas.enable": false`: Disables schema inclusion in the JSON serialization. The captured events will be published as plain JSON without schema information.

- `"decimal.handling.mode": "double"`: Sets how decimal data types should be handled. In this case, decimals will be represented as double-precision floating-point numbers.

- `"slot.name": "slot_member"`: Defines the name of the PostgreSQL replication slot used by the connector to capture changes. Replication slots are a feature in PostgreSQL that allows for efficient replication of changes.
